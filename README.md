## All IPv4 List
This list comprehends a list of all ipv4s in the world, from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.

The listing process took around 3 months, taking into account the roadblocks that eventually got in the way, as well as the processing power of one computer writing 10.000 lines for 412719 files each with all unique IPs with no threading.

The following archive contains 'count' file and the main IP listing archive.

The IP archive contains multiple compressed folders that are separated according to the count file, which makes the file smaller. Without multiple compressions, the size of the file would be around 8GB.
